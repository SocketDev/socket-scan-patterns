/**
 * Pre-approve integrity gate. Packs the tarball locally and asserts its sha1
 * equals the shasum npm recorded when the tarball was staged — run BEFORE
 * `npm stage approve` (the 2FA / OAuth promote) so a divergent artifact never
 * goes public. Two-source comparison (local pack + npm staging). The release
 * pipeline runs the GitHub-asset comparison and `gh attestation verify`
 * before this local gate. Fails
 * LOUD and returns false on any mismatch OR when the staged shasum can't be
 * resolved — the caller drops the entry. Never returns true on missing
 * evidence. Tarball sha1s embed the gzip envelope (platform metadata that
 * differs between CI linux packs and local macOS packs), so a sha1 mismatch
 * falls back to downloading the staged tarball and comparing EXTRACTED
 * CONTENTS per-file — equality there is the honest integrity axis. `pack`,
 * `hashLocalTarball`, and `downloadStagedTarball` are injectable for tests.
